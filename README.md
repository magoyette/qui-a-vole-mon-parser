# Qui a volé mon parser?

An interactive fiction written in French with the [Chapbook](https://github.com/klembot/chapbook) story format for Twee/Twine.

The story can be played on [itch.io](https://magoyette.itch.io/qui-a-vole-mon-parser).

The story is built with [Chapbook Tweego Builder](https://github.com/magoyette/chapbook-tweego-builder), my project to build [Chapbook](https://github.com/klembot/chapbook) stories with the [Tweego](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/) compiler.

The story has been developed in Emacs with the packages [twee-mode](https://github.com/magoyette/twee-mode) and [twee-chapbook-mode](https://github.com/magoyette/twee-chapbook-mode).
